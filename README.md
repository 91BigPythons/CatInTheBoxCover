Use Unity to create front and back AR covers for the box of the board game Cat in the box.

The front uses 3D enhanced text to display the game name and designer. Created a cat box experiment scene using the free assets from the unity store (this is the background of the game)

The back also uses enhanced text to display the game's artist, publisher, and release date. Added a two-minute introductory video displayed via AR. An interactive button has also been added. When the user blocks a specific area, the tutorial video displayed.

The main problem encountered is that for some reason there is no camera display after building and running. However, the camera can be started normally by clicking play in unity. I guess this may be because of the use of vuforia's ARCamera. As an alternative, directly uploaded the source code of the project.

If you want to run this project, please download whole files in one directory, and open it as a unity project, and then you need to import com.ptc.vuforia.engine-10.21.3.tgz for this project.

A easier way to run the project: You can email me the email address your unity uses, and then I can add your email address to my unity collaborate, so you can access the exact same project as on my host.
